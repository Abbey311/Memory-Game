## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[None]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The challenges I encountered in creating this submission had to do with understanding the way in which html, javascript, and css all work together. I had a little bit of javascript experience prior to this, but had never used html or css, and so understanding the functionality of these was relatively challenging. I was able to overcome these challenges by rereading the instructions, and trying to write the code myself, as opposed to copying and pasting from the tutorial. I referred to the tutorial when I needed help, but tried to learn from my own mistakes in order to better understand the material, and to challenge myself in a way that allowed me to learn more efficiently. By doing this, I was actively learning because I was spending a great deal of time on the assignment, and this allowed me to become comfortable with the content. I also utilized the dropdown boxes and references that were found on the tutorial, and read each one as they served as informational resources, and gave context on certain functions and how they work. By reading these, I was given the necessary background information required to complete the tasks, and given enough guidance to fully comprehend the given code.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[The questions I have about web development after completing the submission have to do with html, css, and javascript. I feel like I have a general understanding, but there is still much for me to learn. I find it very interesting how they work together, and how the end result was able to create an entire game, but I would like to learn how this works. I also want to know the limits and capabilities of web development through html, css, and javascript, and would love to explore the other possibilities that are present in web development. In addition to this, there are still minor things such as where the built-in commands and functions come from, and how these development tools are able to call on them in order to develop this software.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them trying to add additional features to make the game more engaging. I would also change the overall display a bit more, to create a sense of uniqueness, and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. The additional features I would add to the game would be speeding up after every single turn, which would make the game a bit harder for the user. Another feature I would add would be to have the computer randomly choose a pattern for every game, instead of hardcoding a solution into an array. This way, the user wonâ€™t know what to expect, and it would make the game a bit more challenging.]
